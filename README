# cub3D

- This project is inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D, which is considered to be the first true FPS in gaming history.
- `cub3D` offers a modern twist on this classic, utilizing raycasting technology to create a dynamic 3D labyrinth exploration experience.

### Bonus Features
- **Mini-Map**: A top-down view that shows the layout of the labyrinth, your current position, and your viewing direction. This is especially useful for navigation and strategy planning.
- **Enhanced Collision**: Unlike many traditional raycasting games where the player can get stuck on walls, `cub3D` implements an advanced collision algorithm.Even when colliding with a wall, the player can continue moving along the wall smoothly without getting stuck. This makes for a more fluid and realistic movement experience.
